# Writing Letters in markdown using pandoc and print on typewriter

This templates allow to print simple letters on a typewriter like that on my
[erika](https://git.muehlberg.net/SvenMb/erika) project. (on [github](https://github.com/SvenMb/erika))

This project is derived from [JensErat/pandoc-scrlttr2](https://github.com/JensErat/pandoc-scrlttr2)

Letters produced for his LaTeX/pdf-Template can be reused here (without any graphics etc)

## Installing the Template and 

To install the templates 'dinbrief.md' and 'dinover.md', either store it in 
the working directoryor move it to the template folder in Pandoc's data directory,
usually ~/.pandoc/templates. The wrapper script 'panletter' must be in a $PATH reachable
directory or you need to call it with path.

## using the wrapper script

simple call (assuming it is in PATH):

    panletter example-letter.md

This will create a file 'example-letter.txt' with your letter.

### Options

With parameter --colums you can adjust the line width of your typewriter.

    panletter --columns=66 example-letter.md

Parameter --page will paginate the output.

    panletter --page=45 example-letter.md

Adds number of page and formfeed after 44 lines (45 line is pagenumber)
If not given the output won't be paginated.

With Parameter --tab you can set to which tabstop the tab (^I) will expand.
This way you set the address and infos on the right side of the header inside
the DIN letter.

    panletter --tab=70 example-letter.md

Sets tabstop to the 70st col.

You can also set the output file.

    panletter --output=letter.txt example-letter.md

You can set both template files

    panletter --template=dinbrief.md --overlay=dinover.md
    
You can see some help and the defaults via

    panletter --help

## Templates

The templates are pandoc templates. The overlay template will be concatenated
to the main template on a line by line base (like unix paste -d ""). A tabs inside the template will be
expandet according to the '--tab' option.

see example why this is done this way and how to use it.
